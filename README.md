About this web app: 
**Our goal is to broaden the possibilities of what it means to learn in a classroom and learn at home through the future of education: personalized learning.**

**With the help of ChatGPT and OpenAi, we would utilize the auto generation of questions to help create questions, presented on a web platform, that are catered to make personalized learning paths for every student.**

**Through different data sets and analytics, teachers and guardians would not only be able to understand areas where students are struggling, but also expand their in-person teaching styles using a virtual application that can increase the engagement and retention of all kinds of students in education.**

Here's a walkthrough of our project:
